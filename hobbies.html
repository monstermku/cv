  <h3>VideoGaming</h3>
  <p>A big reason why we love video games so much, I feel, is because they are an escape from our sometimes boring and monotonous lives. ... Another reason I believe we love video games is because they give us a sense of accomplishment. The feeling
    you get when you complete a good game is a feeling that's hard to compete with.</p>
  <p>Another reason I believe we love video games is because they give us a sense of accomplishment. The feeling you get when you complete a good game is a feeling that’s hard to compete with. It makes you feel important; like you have done something
    right. That’s why we continue to play games that make us scream and rage quit. I know that when I beat a challenging game, especially being a female, I feel like I have done something that a lot of people thought I would never be able to do.
    Unfortunately, people still think girls can’t play video games, but that’s a topic for a different blog post.</p>

  <h3>Traveling</h3>
  <p>Travel takes us out of our comfort zones and inspires us to see, taste and try new things. It constantly challenges us, not only to adapt to and explore new surroundings, but also to engage with different people, to embrace adventures as they
    come and to share new and meaningful experiences with friends and loved ones.
    “I love to travel because it takes me out of my comfort zone and I am always learning something new about myself and about that place each day I'm there.” "For me it's meeting new people and learning about their different way of life - culture,
    traditions, food. And seeing what makes each place so unique!
